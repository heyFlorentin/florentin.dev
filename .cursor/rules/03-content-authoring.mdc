# Content authoring guidelines

## Collections and placement

- Follow the collection schema defined in [src/content/config.ts](mdc:src/content/config.ts).
- Blog posts live under `src/content/blog/**`. Additional sections may have their own subfolders.

## Frontmatter

Use concise, complete frontmatter per the schema. Typical fields:

```yaml
---
title: Your post title
description: One-sentence summary
date: 2025-10-07
tags:
  - tag-one
  - tag-two
draft: false
---
```

## Media and links

- Store images in `public/images/` and reference them with relative paths (they will be served statically).
- External links open according to site logic; use helpers like [src/utils/link.ts](mdc:src/utils/link.ts) when
  relevant.

## Slugs and routing

- Filenames typically define slugs and are resolved by dynamic routes such as
  [src/pages/[...slug].astro](mdc:src/pages/[...slug].astro).
